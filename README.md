## Phone Book project - Storing Contact Details
This project was made as part of my studies as an Software Practical Engineer.
In this project example I will try to build a sample forms to store contact details that you choose. This project was created using Visual Studio Code.

## To Be Honest
Like I said before - this project was made as part of my studies.
As Practical Software Engineer, I was learned only the base of React and tried to do my best.
Yes, I'm sure that I can make it better and I will.
Everyday I'm trying to do my best and learn new things, and I will make it better.
Hope you will enjoy it - and I want to know every single thing that you think I can to improve in this project.
